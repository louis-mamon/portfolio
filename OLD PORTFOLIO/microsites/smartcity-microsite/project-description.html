													<li>Description:
														<ul>
															<li>As part of the Christchurch Spatial Data Infrastructure program, the Forward Works Spatial Coordination (FWSC) project aims to facilitate sharing of information about current and planned horizontal infrastructure and built environment construction, and repair and maintenance activities between the organizations involved in these activities, to enable more efficient planning and coordination of work. Following in the wake of the Christchurch earthquake, the Christchurch CBD is still under reconstruction thus stretching the city’s resources due to the ongoing construction projects. The Forwards Works Viewer is the solution developed to help reduce the strain on the city’s infrastructure. The Viewer gives recovery agencies, public and private sector users a shared online view of horizontal infrastructure repair, planned buildings, and other construction. This will enable enhanced decision making on the scheduling and sequencing of public sector construction activities, and will facilitate the coordination with private sector landowners and property developers on their works planning. This will also help to maximize the pace and efficiency of the built environment recovery, minimizing costs and disruption due to scheduling clashes, and minimize impact on the transport network, and inconvenience to road users. Headed by the Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), the project involves collaboration between LINZ, Christchurch Central Development Unit (CCDU), Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team (SCIRT) and the Christchurch City Council. Media Suite (a local software developer), North South GIS and Jacobs Engineering Group were contracted to develop the viewer.</li>

													<li>Description:
														<ul>
															<li>Earlier this year, Energy Market Services (EMS) launched a new load forecasting service for the electricity market in collaboration with TESLA Asia Pacific. The service will provide users with timely and accurate information to support and improve strategic business decision-making. The load forecasting service will provide half-hourly estimates of electricity consumption up to 14 days in advance – an extra seven days of data compared to what is available currently – alongside weather data and customizable forecasts, based on information provided by MetService. EMS previously conducted a benchmark exercise with a number of participants, which found that the new load forecasting service could reduce load uncertainty by as much as 70%. Customers of the service will be able to benefit through the smart use of the forecast. For instance, through improved bidding strategies and by scheduling load away from likely peak periods as well as other benefits including: basis risk management, scheduling of generation for revenue and portfolio, optimization and more. The electricity market is strengthened when better information is available. This service will enable efficiencies among consumers. Cost reductions from improvements in plant commitment between $3.3 million and $5.8 million for the 2016-2020 period are expected. In the long term, the initiative hopes to bring about lower overall wholesale purchase costs from improved demand response, which would benefit all New Zealanders. The load forecasting service is delivered through EMS’s em6 information exchange via their website.</li>

PUB has built a robust and diversified supply of water known as the ‘Four National Taps’. The water supply comprises of (1) local catchment water, (2) imported water, (3) highly-purified reclaimed water known as NEWater, and (4) desalinated water. Both NEWater and Desalinated Water augment their water supply, allowing Singapore to be more resilient to weather variability.</li>

The government has put in place a “5 waters governance” masterplan to detail the long-term plans for the city’s water needs. In 2008, a Hangzhou water management platform was created, and it was recently comprehensively upgraded to a water-saving online supervision platform that manages more than 94% of the city’s current potable water needs. The system analyses data points from a wide variety of water management solutions such as ground water monitoring services, water-balance test apparatus and services, pipeline leakage rates, water savings monitoring systems (deployed at enterprises and manufacturing plants, for instance), and predictive functions to enhance the city’s reaction rates to water management as well as cope with emergencies (e.g. droughts).  The system uses real-time data collection and information monitoring for the daily rational allocation of water.</li>

															<li>This project is critical to support industry-level transformation for Singapore's global competitiveness in logistics and trade. The revamp is targeted at upgrading the existing TradeXchange and TradeNet systems. The new TradeXchange will support seamless data exchanges between businesses and their partners up and down the supply chain according to the tender documents. With a clearer view of the supply chain, firms can plan more effectively and better collaborate on value-added services. Currently, exporters, importers and logistics players have to subscribe to a number of systems that are not integrated, resulting in multiple data-entry steps, duplication of efforts and high error rates. Meanwhile, TradeNet is the platform for making Customs declarations. The revamped TradeNet will simplify business-to-government data exchanges so that permit processing and other regulatory functions can be completed more easily. Overall, the National Trade Platform is intended to catalyze innovation when firms gather new insights from the richer exchange of data.</li>

													<li>Description:
														<ul>
															<li>The project will provide key information for Environment Canterbury, stakeholder organizations and local communities for setting and managing limits that balance environmental, social, economic and cultural outcomes as well as providing valuable information for farmers. Recent national and regional policy statements give direction to tackling these challenges including a requirement to set quantitative catchment limits for water quality and quantity. These policy statements as well as the goals of the Canterbury Water Management Strategy (CWMS), place good management practice as a core component of regional strategies to manage the impacts of land use on water quality. The Matrix of Good Management (MGM) is a co-developed project designed to establish industry-agreed Good Management Practice (GMP) and to estimate expected nitrogen and phosphorus losses across a range of farming systems, soils and climates operating at GMP in the Canterbury region. To address this, the Farm Portal was developed. An online portal where a user could use their own Overseer file (farm information file) which would have all the necessary information to apply GMP. GMP then is applied in real time to the users Overseer file making it a simple process to get a GMP loss rate. The long term outcome is that over time, a spatial representation of all farms in Canterbury will be developed with actual nutrient loss rates associated with those farms which will give a region wide picture of nutrient loss in relation to potential nutrient loss using Good Management Practice. The portal itself is web based. Users have authenticated log-ons that they use to access it. Once signed up, users can define the area of their land and change it if required. The portal asks the user a series of ‘gating’ questions to gather more information. Now they can use the portal to find out more about their farms nutrient levels in relation to GMP and the information is incorporated to the regional GIS framework so that nutrient levels can be tracked on a regional level.</li>

															<li>This project is being carried out by the Wellington City Council (WCC) and the company Smart Parking Ltd. In 2015, WCC trialed 72 Smart Parking Ltd.’s sensors on Allen St in the Wellington CBD. After a successful trial period the council is expanding the project to CBD-wide with 3,500 new sensors. The sensors provide accurate information on parking space use, turnover and occupancy. Customers using the system will no longer need to return to their car to display a physical ticket as they will now pay for the specific space that they are using. Additionally, an application called SmartApp will enable motorists to identify streets with free parking spots and avoid driving around searching for a place on roads which are already full. The app identifies free spaces and uses GPS to guide the consumer to the park. Smart Parking’s SmartPark solution comprises of flush mounted, anti-slip profile RFID-equipped SmartEye sensors, which use advanced sensing technology to detect when a vehicle has occupied a parking space. SmartRep back office software collates and analyses the live information on how parking space is being used. Accurate vehicle-by-vehicle, minute-by-minute data on actual usage of the city’s facilities gives the council the leading edge in day-to-day management and future planning.</li>

													<li>Description:
														<ul>
															<li>The aim of the project was to shift from an onus on a staff manual monitoring approach of CCTV cameras to a modern automated approach using CCTV analytics. Also, shift from five CCTV platforms to a single one that is accessible from any location including Police Control room and government agencies. CCTV is processed by HPE IDOL engine and integrated into an incident management system. Statistics and pieces that are to be kept are then stored in HPE Vertica. Microsoft Analytics Platform is used to get an integrated reporting front end in real time. CCTV analytics will help staff to manage the system pro-actively including: 1) Automated alerts to operators as the CCTV detects motion in areas where persons are not supposed to be or as they cross into prohibited areas, i.e. railway tracks, 2) Automated alerts connected to events, i.e. rail crossings activated where people or vehicle movement is detected within the rail/closed portion of the road and many more. As well as providing other benefits to AT and stakeholders: 1) The ability to count people and vehicles, direction of travel and speed, 2) The ability to determine accurate road statistics i.e. .where and when vehicles enter and exit the city and other key areas and duration of stay, 3) Enable analytics and monitoring of road initiatives around schools, enhancing public safety, and more. The system will utilize HP’s integrated big data platform, HAVEn, to analyze, understand and act on vast quantities of data of virtually any type including text, images, audio and real-time video. The system will leverage data from a variety of sources, including thousands of security and traffic management cameras, a vast network of road and environmental sensors as well as real-time social media and news feeds. In the first phase of the project, Auckland Transport will focus on improving public safety. Law enforcement will use HP Intelligent Scene Analysis System and license plate recognition for accurate identification and scene analysis for dangerous activities and analyzing safety threats from over 2,000 cameras deployed within Auckland. Going forward this information will be linked with rich insight from social media news sources to provide a comprehensive solution that can proactively identify breaking trends and respond to critical safety incidents for cyclists and transport users.</li>

															<li>As a sea-side city with more than 10% of the population in retired age, Saensuk City's Smart Living initiative puts major emphasis on healthcare for the elderly. The first pilot project was implemented in 2011 in conjunction with NECTEC and Burapha University. In this scheme, households with elders or people with disabilities were provided: 1) wireless switches for electrical appliance so old people do not have to walk to stationary switches, thereby decreasing accident and health risks, 2) houses with old people living alone were attached with flashes and sirens that respond to emergency buttons in risky areas such as bathrooms, as well as portable device with emergency buttons. To upgrade this project, Saensuk City and its partners kicked off the new three-year initiative that will harness Internet of Things and wearables. The elderly or disabled will receive BlueBLE Tags that monitor their health and behavior, and notify other family member in case of emergencies. Tag works with 3 other devices: BlueBLE Dongle, Sensor Hub, and IoT Station.</li>

Following in the wake of the Christchurch earthquake, the Christchurch CBD is still under reconstruction thus stretching the city’s resources due to the ongoing construction projects. The Forwards Works Viewer is the solution developed to help reduce the strain on the city’s infrastructure. The Viewer gives recovery agencies, public and private sector users a shared online view of horizontal infrastructure repair, planned buildings, and other construction. This will enable enhanced decision making on the scheduling and sequencing of public sector construction activities, and will facilitate the coordination with private sector landowners and property developers on their works planning. This will also help to maximize the pace and efficiency of the built environment recovery, minimizing costs and disruption due to scheduling clashes, and minimize impact on the transport network, and inconvenience to road users. Headed by the Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), the project involves collaboration between LINZ, Christchurch Central Development Unit (CCDU), Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team (SCIRT) and the Christchurch City Council. Media Suite (a local software developer), North South GIS and Jacobs Engineering Group were contracted to develop the viewer.</li>

															<li>The city council is concerned about the congestion issue that happens daily in Kuala Lumpur, especially during the peak hours; from 6.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. in the morning and from 4.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. in the evening. One of the contributing factors to this congestion is the heavy and slow moving vehicles that enter the city area during these peak hours. Therefore, to address this issue, city council requires a system to monitor and identify the heavy vehicles that pass through major entrances to the city center during the peak hour. The heavy and slow moving vehicles such as, trucks and commercial heavy vehicles, both cause and suffer from congestion on Kuala Lumpur's streets. These vehicles cause more congestion than smaller, lighter vehicles because they require more road space and are slower to accelerate. Traffic flow (the number of vehicles that can travel on a road over a particular time period) is significantly lower with trucks and commercial vehicles on the road, and the congestion will be triggered when the increasing number of vehicles travelling in the rush hours cannot be passing through the road network.A Heavy Vehicle Classification System (HVCS) is being introduced as a tool to monitor and classify heavy vehicles (five tons and above) that enter the city during the said peak hours. By doing this, traffic management and planning for traffic flow control using system generated statistic will be an efficient way to improve the congestion level of the Kuala Lumpur city. The HVCS utilizes video sensing technology and image processing solution to identify the heavy vehicle. One of the important features of this system is the ability to classify the vehicle types while not required the vehicles to be stopped or diverted into weighing station. The system can accurately classify travelling vehicles, and capture trucks and commercial vehicles that violate the rules. The information, including vehicle registration number, violation time and date, location, together with captured image, is all kept in central server.

															<li>As the government has a long plan to construct an intelligent power grid by 2030, it selected Jeju as a test bed of smart grid technologies and constructed a demonstration complex there. Adding to KEPCO (Korea Electric Power Corporation), big conglomerates such as KT, LG, GS, SK, Hyundai, and Posco have participated in this project. There are 12 consortiums comprised of 168 companies. The first phase of this project where constructed the base infrastructure was conducted 2009 to 2011 and the second phase where operates the demonstration complex at the full coverage level to 2013. This project focused on 5 areas such as smart power grid, smart place, smart renewable, smart service, and smart transportation. Emphasizing these 5 areas, in this project various intelligent power grid solutions were implemented. For example, there were duplex transmission and automated recovery, AMI, real-time electric utility payment data, combination bio-energy with electric networking, EV, EV charging system, demand response, and customized energy information.

															<li>Earlier this year, Energy Market Services (EMS) launched a new load forecasting service for the electricity market in collaboration with TESLA Asia Pacific. The service will provide users with timely and accurate information to support and improve strategic business decision-making. The load forecasting service will provide half-hourly estimates of electricity consumption up to 14 days in advance – an extra seven days of data compared to what is available currently – alongside weather data and customizable forecasts, based on information provided by MetService. EMS previously conducted a benchmark exercise with a number of participants, which found that the new load forecasting service could reduce load uncertainty by as much as 70%. Customers of the service will be able to benefit through the smart use of the forecast. For instance, through improved bidding strategies and by scheduling load away from likely peak periods as well as other benefits including: basis risk management, scheduling of generation for revenue and portfolio, optimization and more. The electricity market is strengthened when better information is available. This service will enable efficiencies among consumers. Cost reductions from improvements in plant commitment between $3.3 million and $5.8 million for the 2016-2020 period are expected. In the long term, the initiative hopes to bring about lower overall wholesale purchase costs from improved demand response, which would benefit all New Zealanders. The load forecasting service is delivered through EMS’s em6 information exchange via their website.</li>

Through the Environment and Water Programme Office (EWI), which spearheads the growth of Singapore’s water industry, the National Research Foundation (NRF) has committed S$470 million (US$344 million) to promote R&D in the water sector. EWI, an inter-agency outfit led by PUB, is spearheading efforts to transform Singapore into a global hydrohub. Through funding promising research projects, the EWI aims to foster leading-edge technologies and create a thriving and vibrant research community in Singapore. Today, Singapore has a thriving cluster of over 130 water companies and 26 research centres. PUB is actively working with the industry to bring about water initiatives that can address its quest for a diversified and sustatinable supple of water. Singapore’s national water agency the Public Utilities Board (PUB) has built a robust and diversified supply of water known as the ‘Four National Taps’. The water supply comprises (1) local catchment water, (2) imported water, (3) highly-purified reclaimed water known as NEWater, and (4) desalinated water. Both NEWater and Desalinated Water augment our water supply, allowing Singapore to be more resilient to weather variability.

															<li>This project is critical to support industry-level transformation for Singapore's global competitiveness in logistics and trade. The revamp is targeted at upgrading the existing TradeXchange and TradeNet systems. The new TradeXchange will support seamless data exchanges between businesses and their partners up and down the supply chain, according to the tender documents. With a clearer view of the supply chain, firms can plan more effectively and better collaborate on value-added services. Currently, exporters, importers and logistics players have to subscribe to a number of systems that are not integrated, resulting in multiple data-entry steps, duplication of efforts and high error rates. Meanwhile, TradeNet is the platform for making Customs declarations. The revamped TradeNet will simplify business-to-government data exchanges so that permit processing and other regulatory functions can be completed more easily. Overall, the National Trade Platform is intended to catalyse innovation when firms gather new insights from the richer exchange of data.

															<li>The project will provide key information for Environment Canterbury, stakeholder organisations and local communities for setting and managing to limits that balance environmental, social, economic and cultural outcomes as well as providing valuable information for farmers. Managing the impacts of land use on water quality and accounting for the many competing demands and values placed on water resources is a national and a regional challenge. Recent national and regional policy statements give direction to tackling these challenges including a requirement to set quantitative catchment limits for water quality and quantity. These policy statements as well as the goals of the Canterbury Water Management Strategy (CWMS), place good management practice as a core component of regional strategies to manage the impacts of land use on water quality.The Matrix of Good Management (MGM) is a co-developed project designed to establish industry-agreed Good Management Practice (GMP) and to estimate expected nitrogen and phosphorus losses across a range of farming systems, soils and climates operating at GMP in the Canterbury region. Although there is widespread support for the implementation of good management practices across primary industries, until now there have been no commonly agreed definitions of GMP, nor a good understanding of the nutrient losses that occur on farms operating at GMP. For any particular GMP there will be a range of estimated nutrient losses that vary with differing land uses and different soil types and climate zones. The MGM project partners are Environment Canterbury, Deer Industry New Zealand, Beef + Lamb NZ, Hort NZ, Foundation for Arable Research, DairyNZ, NZPork, Plant and Food Research, AgResearch and Landcare Research. The technological solution developed is Farm Portal. An online portal was developed where a user could use their own Overseer file (farm information file) which would have all the necessary information to apply GMP. GMP is applied in real time to the users Overseer file making it a simple process to get a GMP loss rate. The long term outcome is that over time a spatial representation of all farms in Canterbury will be developed with actual nutrient loss rates associated with those farms which will give a region wide picture of nutrient loss in relation to potential nutrient loss using Good Management Practice. 
The portal itself is web based. Users have authenticated logons that they use to access it. Once signed up users can define the area of their land and change it if required. The portal asks the user a series of ‘gating’ questions to gather more information. Now they can use the portal to find out more about their farms nutrient levels in relation to GMP and the information is incorporated to the regional GIS framework so that nutrient levels can be tracked on a regional level.

It is also intended to be Philippines' answer to the threat of climate change. The Clark Green City development is generally mixed-use and is sructured into 5 districts defined by their main functions. An (1) educational hub is just one of five districts that will rise in the city. Based on its Master Development Plan, Clark Green City will also have (2) a government district, (3) a central business district, (4) an agri-forestry research and development district,and (5) a wellness and eco-tourism district. The Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) is still in the process of facilitating most of the bids for modernizing and developing Clark Green City. Road works are already ongoing though, which is crucial to the first phase of the project. Among the bids for this initiative, the ones already awarded include the project design. Master planning company AECOM has won the open competition for the best optimized design of Clark Green City’s Conceptual Master Development Plan, besting four other designs. As of 2016, BCDA has also recently signed MOAs with Sunray Power Inc (renewable energy), Philippine Science High School (fab lab), and Vivapolis France (solutions not yet disclosed). The World Bank will assist the BCDA in the area of innovation and sustainable green development. Reaching out to Ivy League schools is included in the plan. To goal is to make the city a fully walkable one, where pedestrianization and creating efficient mass transport will be prioritized but it's still in the implementation phase.

														<ul>
															<li>This project is being carried out by the Wellington City Council (WCC) and the company Smart Parking Ltd. In 2015 WCC trialed 72 of Smart Parking Ltd.’s sensors on Allen St in the Wellington CBD in 2015. After a successful trial period the council is expanding the project CBD-wide with 3,500 new sensors. The sensors provide accurate information on parking space use, turnover and occupancy. Customers using the system will no longer need to return to their car to display a physical ticket as they will now pay for the specific space that they are using. Additionally, an application called SmartApp will enable motorists to identify streets with free parking spots and avoid driving around searching for a place on roads which are already full. The app identifies free spaces and uses GPS to guide the consumer to the park. Smart Parking’s SmartPark solution comprises of flush mounted, anti-slip profile RFID-equipped SmartEye sensors, which use advanced sensing technology to detect when a vehicle has occupied a parking space. SmartRep backoffice software collates and analyses the live information on how parking space is being used. Accurate vehicle-by-vehicle, minute-by-minute data on actual usage of the city’s facilities gives the council the leading edge in day-to-day management and future planning.

															<li>This initiative is provided through mobile application by the Ministry of the Interior. Based on GPS, a user's location information is conveyed to family members or a guardian in real-time through texting or SNS including Facebook, Twitter, and Kakao. According to the safe spots as well as dangerous spots which a user appoints for himself, it can alarm to a guardian if the user gets out of the safe spots and vice versa. When an emergent situation happens, it is called to a guardian or someone who a user appoints in advance automatically including police station, 119(emergency center). Adding to these fundamental functions, this initiative also provides useful information related to public safety facilities such as police station, 119, hospital, pharmacy, and emergency shelters based on GPS.

															<li>The aim of the project was to shift from an onus on a staff manual monitoring approach of CCTV cameras to a modern automated approach using CCTV analytics. Also, shift from five CCTV platforms to a single one that is accessible from any location including Police Control room and govt. agencies.CCTV is processed by HPE IDOL engine and integrated into an incident management system. Statistics and pieces that are to be kept are then stored in HPE Vertica. Microsoft Analytics Platform is used to get an integrated reporting front end in real time. CCTV analytics will help staff to manage the system pro-actively including: 1) Automated alerts to operators as the CCTV detects motion in areas where persons are not supposed to be or as they cross into prohibited areas, i.e. railway tracks, 2) Automated alerts connected to events, i.e. rail crossings activated where people or vehicle movement is detected within the rail/closed portion of the road, 3) Congregation of groups of people outside of the norm, 4) Alerts to detect property vandalism on AT infrastructure, 5) Detection of vehicles stopping in the roadway or curb side on the motorways, clear lanes and bus lanes. As well as providing other benefits to AT and stakeholders: 1) The ability to count people and vehicles, direction of travel and speed, 2) The ability to determine accurate road statistics i.e. .where and when vehicles enter and exit the city and other key areas and duration of stay, 3) Enable analytics and monitoring of road initiatives around schools, enhancing public safety, 4) Ability to detect crimes, either against people or property, 5) The ability to determine vehicle entry points and exits points in city for traffic planning, 6) Ability to use CCTV cameras on traffic intersections to detect cyclists and use this to activate traffic lights, preventing red light running, 7) Ability to measure and count vehicles running red lights. The system will utilize HP’s integrated big data platform, HAVEn, to analyze, understand and act on vast quantities of data of virtually any type including text, images, audio and real-time video. The system will leverage data from a variety of sources, including thousands of security and traffic management cameras, a vast network of road and environmental sensors as well as real-time social media and news feeds. In the first phase of the project, Auckland Transport will focus on improving public safety. Law enforcement will use HP Intelligent Scene Analysis System and license plate recognition for accurate identification and scene analysis for dangerous activities and analyzing safety threats from over 2,000 cameras deployed within Auckland. Going forward this information will be linked with rich insight from social media news sources to provide a comprehensive solution that can proactively identify breaking trends and respond to critical safety incidents for cyclists and transport users.

The project will provide a single healthcare portal, with one system across the South Island, it will streamline and integrate clinical and administrative functions, making tasks simpler for staff, and providing patients with a more efficient health care service. SI PICS includes patient demographics, Master Patient Index, appointment booking, waiting list management, patient transfers, record of patient activity, reporting, admission and discharges and alerts and allergies. By implementing a regional solution, DHBs can share resources and collaborate better, and ultimately provide more efficient, safer transfer of patient information, and staff, between services around the region. Provides health workers with coordinated and consistent access to a single system. Orion Health is the company that has been contracted to work with the South Island Alliance to make SI PICS a reality. “Orion Health is leveraging its ENTERPRISE Patient Management platform to create the regional system. SI PICS will not only replace eight different patient information management systems currently in use but embed new functionality to meet the changing demands on health care. SI PICS will also integrate with Orion’s clinical portal Health Connect South (HCS), which most of the DHBs are already operating, as well as other innovations being rolled out via the South Island Alliance such as eReferrals.” Features of the ENTERPRISE patient management system include: a single multi-lingual web-based system on desktop or mobile, clinicians can capture, store, retrieve and view a single longitudinal electronic medical patient record from any location within the system. Booking resources are optimised to process patients faster while lab and radiology results are also available in the patient’s record as soon as they are created, reducing result wait times for patients.  A configurable and integrated patient administration management module allows seamless connectivity between legacy and third party health systems.

															<li>As a sea-side city with more than 10% of population in retired age, Saensuk City's Smart Living initiative has major emphasis on healthcare for elderly. The first pilot project was implemented in 2011 in conjunction with NECTEC and Burapha University. In this scheme, households with elders or people with disabilities were provided: 1) wireless switches for electrical appliance so old people do not have to walk to stationary switches, thereby decrease accident and health risks, 2) houses with old people living alone were attached with flashes and sirens that response to emergency bottons in risky areas such as bathroom, as well as portable device with emergency buttons. To upgrade this project, Saensuk City and same partners kicked off the new three-year initiative that will harness Internet of Things and wearables. Old or disabled person will receive BlueBLE Tag that monitor his health and behavior, and notify other family member in case of emergency. Tag works with 3 other devices: BlueBLE Dongle, Sensor Hub, and IoT Station.

(1) 싱가포르의 LTA(Land Transport Authority)는 2020년까지 차세대 ERP 시스템을 출범할 방침이다. 입찰을 따낸 NCS-MHI는 5억5,600만 싱가포르 달러(미화 4억800만 달러) 규모의 시스템을 구축하게 된다. 1998년부터 운영되어온 현재의 갠트리(gantry)를 대체하게 될 이 새로운 ERP 시스템은 싱가포르 전역에 설치되며 이동 거리를 토대로 도로 요금을 징수하게 된다.
(2) LTA는 종합적인 교통 운송 기획자를 발굴하기 위한 협력 사항을 공식적으로 요청했다. 이에 대한 상세 정보는 http://www.lta.gov.sg/cfc/에서 제공된다.
(3) 현재 통근하는 사람들은 자신들의 목적지까지 가기 위해 Beeline의 좌석을 쉽게 예약할 수 있다. 이는 크라우드소싱과 익명의 대중 교통 데이터를 활용해 ‘수요 지향적인’ 통근 방법을 제공한다.
(4) AV 기술을 활용한 자율 주행 셔틀은 가든스 바이 더 베이(Gardens by the Bay) 지역(2015년 12월 예정)과 센토사(2016년 1월 예정)에서 시작할 계획이다.
(5) 터미널 사이의 화물 운송을 위한 자율 트럭 플래투닝(platooning) 기술을 공동으로 개발하기 위해 싱가포르 항만공사(Port of Singapore Authority)와 양해 각서(MOU)가 체결되었다.
LTA는 AV 기술의 대중 교통 활용 방안과 교통 수송 분담 서비스에 적용하기 위한 방안을 모색하기 위해 8개의 로컬 및 국제 제안서에 대한 평가 작업에 돌입했다. 2016년 하반기에 시범 프로그램을 적용할 방침이다.
(6) 자율 주행 차량 기술과 모빌리티 컨셉을 위한 싱가포르 최초의 테스트 사이트로 원-노스(One-North) 지역이 선정된 이후, I2R(Institute for Infocomm Research)과 SMART(Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology)가 6킬로미터의 테스트 경로를 따라 시범 운행되고 있다.
(7) LTA의 Data Mall을 통해 교통 데이터뿐만 아니라 다양한 정보도 대중들에게 제공되고 있다. 이러한 정보에는 버스 도착 시간, 좌석 이용 가능 여부, 택시 이용 가능 여부에 대한 실시간 데이터가 포함된다.
(8) LTA(Land Transport Authority)의 MyTransport App는 향상된 버스 이용 가능 시간과 버스 탑승 정보를 제공한다.
(9) LTA는 또한 웨어러블 기술을 사용한 비접촉식 모바일 결제 시스템에 대한 6개월 간의 시범 서비스를 출범했다. 손목에 착용하는 스마트밴드(SmartBands)가 대중 교통 및 상점에서 편리하고 신속하게 결제할 수 있도록 테스트되고 있다."

															<li>싱가포르는 2006년 이후 물과 환경 기술을 핵심 성장 분야로 선정했으며 R&D 기지와 물 솔루션의 원천으로서의 입지를 강화하고 있다. 싱가포르의 물 산업의 성장을 확산시키고 있는 EWI(Environment and Water Programme Office)를 통해, NRF(National Research Foundation)은 물 분야에서 R&D를 촉진하기 위해 4억7천만 싱가포르 달러(미화 기준 3억4,400만 달러)의 예산을 편성했다. PUB가 이끄는 관련 기관 간의 팀으로 구성된 EWI는 싱가포르를 글로벌 하이드로허브(hydrohub)로 전환하는데 역량을 집중하고 있다. 펀드 지원을 받는 연구 프로젝트를 통해, EWI는 최첨단 기술을 육성하고 번성시키며 유관 연구 커뮤니티의 활성화를 목표로 하고 있다. 현재, 싱가포르는 130여 물 관련 기업들과 26개의 연구 센터를 유치하고 있다. PUB는 다양하고 지속 가능한 물 공급을 위한 요구 사항에 부응할 수 있는 물 프로젝트를 활성화하기 위해 업계와 긴밀히 협력하고 있다. 싱가포르의 국립 물 기관인 PUB(Public Utilities Board)는 4대 국가 수자원 공급 계획(Four National Taps)으로 알려진 견고하고 분산된 물 공급 계획을 수립했다. 수자원 공급은 (1) 지역에서 공급되는 물 (2) 해외에서 수입되는 물 (3) NEWater로 알려진 고도로 정제된 재생수 (4) 염분이 제거된 담수로 구성된다. NEWater와 염분이 제거된 담수 모두 물 공급을 증가시킬 수 있어 싱가포르가 기후 변동성으로부터 보다 탄력적으로 대응할 수 있게 해준다.

CWMS(Canterbury Water Management Strategy)와 함께 이러한 정책은 토지 사용이 수질에 끼치는 영향을 관리하기 위한 지역적 전략의 핵심 요인으로 뛰어난 관리 관행을 제공한다. MGM(Matrix of Good Management)은 업계가 합의한 GMP(Good Management Practice)을 정립하고 농경 시스템과 캔터베리 지역의 GMP에서 운용되는 토양과 기후에서 질소와 인의 손실이 어느 정도인지 추정하기 위해 공동으로 개발된 프로젝트이다. GMP를 도입하는 데에 있어서 주요 산업군들이 지지를 표명하고 있지만 현재까지 GMP에 대해 공동으로 합의한 정의는 아직 존재하지 않으며 GMP 기반의 농장에서 발생하는 영양분 손실에 대해 제대로 이해하고 있지도 않다. 어떤 GMP에서도 토지 사용과 토양의 형태, 기후 지대가 달라짐에 따라 추정되는 영양분 손실 역시 다양하다. MGM 프로젝트 파트너들은 Environment Canterbury를 비롯해, Deer Industry New Zealand, Beef + Lamb NZ, Hort NZ, Foundation for Arable Research, DairyNZ, NZPork, Plant and Food Research, AgResearch and Landcare Research 등이며, 개발된 기술적인 솔루션은 Farm Portal이다. 사용자들이 GMP에 필요한 정보를 입력할 수 있는 자신의 감독(Overseer) 파일(농장 정보 파일)을 사용할 수 있도록 개발된 온라인 포털로, 감독 파일의 사용자들이 GMP 손실률을 간단하게 처리할 수 있도록 GMP가 실시간으로 적용된다. 장기적으로 시간이 지남에 따라 캔터베리의 모든 농장에 대해 GMP를 사용해 잠재적인 영양분 손실과 관련된 지역 전반적인 상태를 보여주는 공간적인 표현이 가능해질 것이다. 
포털 자체는 웹 기반으로, 사용자들은 액세스를 위해 로그인한다. 가입된 사용자들은 자신의 토지에 대해 규정하고 필요에 따라 변경할 수 있다. 추가 정보를 얻기 위해 포털은 사용자들에게 일련의 ‘관문’ 형태의 질문을 한다. 사용자들은 GMP와 관련된 자신의 농장의 영양분의 수준에 대해 자세한 정보를 찾을 수 있으며, 정보들은 영양분 수준이 지역적인 차원에서 추적될 수 있도록 지역의 GIS 프레임워크와 연동된다."

															<li>웰링턴 시 의회(Wellington City Council)와 Smart Parking Ltd.가 주도하고 있는 프로젝트로, 2015년에 WCC는 웰링턴 CBD의 Allen St.에 Smart Parking Ltd.의 72개의 센서를 설치한 시범 서비스를 진행했다. 시험 운행이 성공을 거둔 후, 시의회는 프로젝트를 CBD 전역으로 확대, 3,500개의 센서를 추가로 설치했다. 이 센서들은 주차 공간 활용률과 회전율, 점유율에 대한 정확한 정보를 제공한다. 이 시스템을 사용하는 고객들은 자신들이 주차한 장소에 대한 지불이 가능해져 주차 요금 지불을 위해 특정 장소로 이동해 티켓을 보여줄 필요가 없다. 게다가, SmartApp 애플리케이션을 통해 운전자들은 여유 주차장이 어디인지 확인할 수 있으며 주차장을 찾아 이리저리 차를 운전하지 않아도 된다. 이 앱은 주차 공간을 확인하고 GPS를 사용해 주차장까지 안내한다. Smart Parking의 SmartPark 솔루션은 내장형의 미끄럼 방지 기능의 RFID가 탑재된 SmartEye 센서로 구성되어 있는데, 차량이 주차장을 점유하는 것을 탐지하는 진보된 센서 기술을 사용한다. SmartRep 백오피스 소프트웨어는 주차 공간 활용에 대한 정보를 수집하고 분석한다. 웰링턴 시설을 사용하는 차량별, 시간별 데이터가 정확하게 제공되어 매일매일의 관리와 향후 계획에 중추적 역할을 담당하게 될 것으로 기대된다.

SI PICS에는 환자의 인구통계학적 특징, 환자 색인(Master Patient Index), 진료 예약, 대기 목록 관리, 환자 이송, 환자 활동 기록, 리포팅, 입원 및 퇴원, 알러지 정보 등이 포함되어 있다. 지역 솔루션을 도입함으로써, DHB는 리소스를 공유하고 협업을 강화할 수 있게 되었으며, 궁극적으로는 지역 주변의 서비스 간에, 그리고 직원 간에 환자의 정보를 보다 효과적이며 안전하게 전송할 수 있게 되었다. 의료 관계자들은 단일한 시스템에 조율되고 일관된 접근이 가능해진다. Orion Health는 SI PICS를 도입하는데 있어서 South Island Alliance와 공조하고 있다. “Orion Health는 지역 시스템 구축을 위해 ENTERPRISE Patient Management 플랫폼을 활용하고 있다. SI PICS는 현재 사용 중인 8개의 개별 환자 정보 관리 시스템을 대체할 뿐만 아니라 의료 분야의 변화에 대한 요구 사항에 대응할 수 있는 새로운 기능들을 제공하고 있다. 또한 SI PICS는 Orion의 임상 포털 HCS(Health Connect South)과도 통합될 예정인데, DHB가 이미 HCS를 대부분 운영 중이며 South Island Alliance를 통해 eReferrals 등 다른 혁신들도 제공되고 있다.” ENTERPRISE 환자 관리 시스템의 대표적인 기능은 다음과 같다: 데스크톱이나 모바일을 토대로 한 단일한 다중 언어의 웹 기반의 시스템, 의료진들은 어디에서나 시스템 내부의 전자 의료 환자 기록을 캡쳐하고 저장하며 검색하고 찾아볼 수 있다. 진료 예약도 더욱 신속하게 진행되며 실험실과 방사선 촬영 결과 역시 시행되자마자 이용 가능하기 때문에 환자의 대기 시간도 단축된다. 설정이 가능하고 통합된 형태의 환자 관리 모듈을 통해 레거시 및 써드 파티 의료 시스템간의 끊김 없는 연결이 가능하다.
